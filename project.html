      <p><strong>Upon consideration, the team has decided to move forward with the idea of sustainability in the form of an application. Global warming and the environment is an ongoing discussion being had across the world, with countless suggestions and plans of attack to halt the decline of our world. Our aim is to encourage users to be more mindful about their contributions and do their part in the fight towards it. Bringing easily accessible information and education to everyday people is essential in this goal.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>The application has a few features, one would allow the user to input their weekly (optional) grocery lists and purchases, the extent of which is completely up to them. If the user decides that they want assistance in ways that they can reduce food waste, they can input these items accordingly. Alternatively, the user can also input any purchases made on items (food or other house-hold items) that come in packaging for material waste purposes. </strong> </p>
      <p><strong>The food input side would not be restricted to new purchases, if the user already has items in which they are struggling to find what to do with them, these can be entered as well. In result, users would be getting more of their money’s worth out of their purchases and encouraging zero-waste cooking and consumption, there for reducing their food wastage!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>This function would provide users with suggestions which would see them through using the extent of their fresh produce where possible. Whether it be recipes that include use of the individual items and their not always desired elements or suggestions in how to combine products from the inputted list in a collaborative way. Users would have the ability to input the amounts of what they already have from previous weeks that are still of use and get the same information, providing a level of education to the user if they are unaware of what is and is not edible from their fruit and veggies! &nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>For non-perishable items (or ones with a little bit longer of a lifespan) with majority left over or completely un-opened, if the user simply does not want to use or necessarily need this item anymore, using their device location, they would be connected to local food drives and charities where these items could be donated and passed on to people who are in need, thus contributing to reducing food poverty.&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The application would hold an index of the suggestions/recipes/resources that it connects the user to. Although more efficiently would have the ability to scan the web, similar to a reverse image search, with the use of key/’trigger’ words to return pieces of information that are associated with what is entered.&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Also included would be the utilization of the device’s camera software, to scan items and barcodes for retrieval of this information, for more of a time efficient experience. This saves the user from having to manually look up and enter all of their desired inputs. This would not limit packaged items, this function could be used on fresh produce as well, all that would be required would be a quantity. Another use of this tool would be providing an estimated lifespan of your fresh produce, programming the camera to identify indicators of ripeness or optimal quality– giving you a time frame to use the products before they spoil. Scanning your package barcodes would also return the user information about materials, and how they need to be broken down for proper disposal. Further development of this application would see the use of Geolocation/location services on the device in which is being used. Allowing this</strong> <strong>application to be more usable and accessible to people from all over. Location services would also play a crucial part in implementing a forum where communities can come together and contact and hold discussions, for their everyday solutions, advice and ideas. Whether it be to local households or local businesses, it gives individuals an opportunity to be a part of and connect with their community. Sustainable packaging is where businesses are slowly but surely moving towards. RECLAIM could not only be for the common household, but an application that businesses might deem as useful as they make their moves in keeping up to date and relevant to their customers wanting to support sustainable companies. Businesses that do not already use sustainable packaging for their products, could be provided a platform in which they can connect to already sustainable businesses – and where they can access their eco-friendly products and initiatives. House-hold sustainability implies that gardening is involved to some extent, RECLAIM would provide a platform for gardeners and gardening businesses to be of service to communities for where they see fit, for either part of the re use of food elements like planting seeds/propagation, or providing information on how composting and food scrap bins. The list of things that could feature on this application are endless considering the amount of steps that people can take to live more sustainable lives, but ultimately as long as the resources are accessible to people, they are willing to give it a go. &nbsp;</strong></p>
