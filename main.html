      <p>Meet<strong> RECLAIM</strong>, a group of like-minded students working together to produce an application to motivate and assist individuals to reduce their weekly household waste and get the most out of their weekly spending. The name RECLAIM has been chosen because it is memorable and directly relates to our message of making the most of household waste and reclaiming materials that would otherwise be thrown away. The following section of the report will outline the students involved in producing this project and will compare the test outcomes and ideal jobs identified in Assignment 1. Information has been reviewed based on prior feedback and new learnings within the team. </p>
      <p>What we have put across the various pages is the information that will explain some of the current technologies in use, or widely used in the IT industry.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

        <h3>A sneek Peek.</h3>
        <p>The application has a few features, one would allow the user to input their weekly (optional) grocery lists and purchases, the extent of which is completely up to them. If the user decides that they want assistance in ways that they can reduce food waste, they can input these items accordingly. Alternatively, the user can also input any purchases made on items (food or other house-hold items) that come in packaging for material waste purposes.</p>

        <h3>Snapshot</h3>
        <p>Software Engineer positions seem to be the most in demand out the of four job titles with the Technical Lead positions following closely. The User Experience position still produced a positive amount of job listings with close to 1000 positions in Australia currently being listed. The Mechatronic Engineer position had the least amount of positions currently listed, but this may be due to it being more of a niche area, especially in Australia.</p>
